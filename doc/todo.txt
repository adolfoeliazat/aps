- Error during loadPageForURL() can be presented in two ways:
      1) Show error modal and stay on same page
      2) Go to new page and show error banner there
  Should support both (currently only (1) is implemented).

- Full-text search for non-admin users should not look into `adminNotes` field.
  Maintain separate `tsv` and `adminTsv`.
