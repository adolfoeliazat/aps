- Top-right nav title should correspond to active dynamic page.

  What if user was at Dashboard (so at top-right there is "Dashboard") and then goes to
  something static like FAQ. Top-right nav should still be "Dashboard", but from where does
  static page get this information?
  
  Or it's better to show user's name instead of "Dashboard". Same question here.
