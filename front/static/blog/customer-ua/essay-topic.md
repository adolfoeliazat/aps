Henry Miller once said, ‘Writing, like life itself, is a voyage of discovery’. In this life we are guided by our parents, teachers and mentors who constantly teach us how to properly plan our steps in order to make as few errors as possible. Life is driven by other men’s experience.

When choosing a good topic for your informative speech, high school debate, college essay or research, brainstorm your topic ideas first! Take a sheet of paper and a pen, draw a line in the center of the paper, and write questions on the left and answers on the right. Ask yourself:

* What you are interested in
* Which topic has the greatest potential to inspire your creative thinking
* What you feel strongly about
* What you are more competent about
* What you want to learn more about
* Whether you have recently watched anything interesting and attention-grabbing on TV

C’mon! Polish your brain! Open your eyes! What if a good argumentative essay topic is hiding in your fridge? Maybe there is a good informative speech topic hanging in your wardrobe?
