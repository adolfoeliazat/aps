These days high school debate (from the Latin “debatum” meaning “to reach an argument between two opposite viewpoints”)
is undoubtedly one of the most popular forms of academic discussions. High school debate topics in the United States 
are diverse and selected with purpose to involve students into two essential processes: argumentative thinking and 
communication. All modern US secondary and high schools use debate as an integral element of classroom activity, as a 
form of knowledge appraisal, testing and skill gap detection. High school debate topics generally relate to students’ 
research activity (development of information management skills) and to the educational activity (development of 
capability to work individually and in team; development of leadership qualities).

Modern debate topics for high school students are selected with purpose to teach them how to analyze different 
problems (past and current) thoroughly and to recognize tolerance and respect as the highest values to be considered 
at problem discussion. High school debate topics must encourage and motivate students to search for truth rather 
than just to practice rhetoric. In other words, competitiveness and hunger for victory should not be dominant over 
readiness and willingness to understand and explore the subject matter.

Debate topics for high school students should not stimulate the use of any double standards, but should promote 
tolerance to other men’s standpoints and search for common values, considering the difference of debate participants.

High school debate topics should never be used as propaganda of any political parties and actions, advertisement of 
organizations and infrastructures, exaltation of some particular idea or personality.

Educators admit the fact that sometimes it is very difficult to choose the right high school debate topic for 
classroom activity. The topic must possess a set of specific properties to be able to transform a classroom discussion 
into a debate, and namely: it should be formulated in a way that would reflect the modern students’ lifestyles and 
meet their expectations (school debate topic must catch students’ attention); it must be somehow relative to students’ 
area of interests and current research/study theme; it must be up to date and must consider further development, 
real-life implementation and alternative solutions.

So, what classroom debate topics may possess these characteristics? Our online survey finds that the most popular high 
school debate topics in the United States are:

* Should your class be considered for a field trip this year?
* Should school uniform become obligatory?
* Should slow achievers be permitted to have a job such as baby-sitting or mowing yards?
* Should you be allowed to spend your own money in the way you want?
* Should you be allowed to come to the class with extraordinary hair styles and excessive piercing?
* Should you be allowed to watch R-rated movies?
* Should your parents permit you to attend sleep-over parties?
* Should your parents require that you do chores around the house?
* Should you wear formal clothes for special occasions if your parents require it from you and you do not feel like doing this?
* Should you be permitted to have any hobby you want?
* Should your parents permit you to get a tattoo?
* Should you be allowed to purchase alcohol and cigarettes before you are 21?
* Should light drugs like marihuana be legalized?
* Should you be permitted to bring your pet to the classroom?

However, besides classroom debate, many US high schools organize formal academic debate for which high school debate 
topics, different from those used in the class, are chosen. During such formal debates students are divided in two 
groups, the assigned instructor provides a student debate topic and the group of couches (usually representatives of 
the academic staff and their invited colleagues from other high schools) judge the debate. In this case high school 
debate resembles some internal oratory contest or an interesting game. The formal debate should adhere to some ethical 
norms and all three parties – debaters, instructors and couches – must follow these norms which are, in fact, mutual 
respect and tolerance, sincerity, honesty and cultural exchange of ideas.

At discussion of high school debate topics debaters should keep away from attacking their opponents and should argue 
in a friendly manner. It is required that debaters use precise data and facts when constructing an argument and do not 
state anything that does not fall within the limits of their own expertise and knowledge base. It is forbidden for 
debaters to misrepresent facts, examples and opinions. Debaters must listen to their opponents attentively and must 
not misrepresent their statements in further discussions.

For formal academic debates topics for high school students are usually chosen by the debate organizers. 
The instructors should make sure that debaters are cogent to the school debate topic and do not go to debris.

Our research shows that formal high school debate topics widely used in the United States are rather politics and 
business oriented. High school debate topics evidence that modern US society is very much concerned about 
President Bush’s governance, conflicts in the Middle East, gun control, threats to liberty and democracy etc. 
To exemplify this observation, let us view the Michigan Education Report and look at the program of 2005 High School 
Debate Workshop hosted by the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, one of the leading America’s academic debate 
organizers and councilors. The workshop was attended by more than 300 high school debaters and their instructors. 
During the workshop the high school debate topic was: “Resolved: That the United States federal government should 
substantially decrease its authority either to detain without charge or to search without probable cause”. 
As an opening of this student debate topic the quotation excerpted from the National Federation of State High School 
Associations Report was used: “The American Constitution was designed to limit and constrain the use of power in order 
to protect liberty. But as the founders knew, and as has become even clearer in modern times, liberty can be 
threatened even by well-meaning people. . . The greatest dangers to liberty lurk in insidious encroachment by men of 
zeal, well-meaning but without understanding” 
([http://www.mackinac.org/pubs/mer/article.aspx?ID=7480](http://www.mackinac.org/pubs/mer/article.aspx?ID=7480)).

We are using this example as an argument to the above statement that formal high school debate topics substantially 
reflect current concerns of present-day America’s society. The Mackinac High School Debate Workshop of 2005 was 
considered to be the best debate program in ten years.

Other less prominent examples show that the most popular formal high school debate topics in the United States are:

* Should wearing a helmet at biking be mandatory?
* Does the US President do a good job?
* Should the Pledge of Allegiance be recited in schools on a daily basis?
* Is beauty only skin deep?
* Does our society have a right to put convicts to death?
* Should cloning be outlawed?
* Should animals be used for scientific research and experiments?

So, as we can see, high school debate topics substantially reflect the key questions that both the US policy-makers 
and average citizens put themselves every now and then. Putting some actual and commonplace topic at stake, educators 
involve their students in modeling of real-life situations and teach them to be able to argumentatively defend their 
own standpoints and to honestly attack the opposite viewpoints. And no secret that these abilities are sometimes more 
important in real life than any theoretical knowledge obtained during high school lectures.
